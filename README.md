# SexyCurves
Source code for my horrible curved windows 10 project. I would not recommend directly using my code, not because I care, but because it could literally damage your computer.


First you'll need the SDL development libraries (https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php)

Follow along with this gude to start a fresh SDL project in visual studio, you'll need to do all sorts of environment variable adding and paths to get your IDE to start using SDL, and hence avoid thousands of errors. (https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/)

Then take a look at my code, it should be full of comments and commented out functions. It may look complex, but I promise it's just stupid. I essentially manually programmed the pixels I knew I needed to draw black by doing some maths in my head and imagining my screen as a big 2560x1440 grid.

Thanks for checking out my project, and good luck!
